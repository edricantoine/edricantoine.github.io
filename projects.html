        <p>This is the project that I have been working on the most lately. Inspired by my love of old-school turn-based JRPGs, I have attempted to create a game
            emulating that style, programmed entirely in Java! The GUI was created using the Swing framework, and the turn-based battle system is fully functional. 
            However, I haven't been able to work on this one as much lately, due to being preoccupied with university. <br>

            Currently, the game has two levels, with more planned to be added when I have the time. Also includes something vaguely resembling a storyline. <br>
            I know it's not perfect, but maybe you should give it a try!
            <br>
            Download the game and its .jar file <a href=https://github.com/edricantoine/Hopeful_RPG.>here.</a> The README file contains all you need to know about running the game.

                My final project for the CPSC210 course at the University of British Columbia. This is a simple, elegant password manager that helps you keep your 
                passwords organized and all in one place. Functions include adding entries with a label, username, and password, and being able to mark an entry's category
                and importance.
                <br>
                The user is also able to modify and delete entries at will, search for an entry with a specific label, and sort the displayed entries by category and importance.
                <br>
                Compile and run this program from the command line, and enjoy your new, organized password experience!

                My first foray into Python, API usage, and making Discord bots! This simple Discord bot will respond to users' commands with certain text responses, all of which 
                are outlined in the README file on this project's <a href="https://github.com/edricantoine/BotReal">GitHub page.</a>
                <br>
                If, for any reason, you want to incorporate this bot into your Discord server, just send me an email at the address on the homepage of this site!
                <br>
                However, doing so is not recommended as I have not yet found a way to continuously host the bot - this means that it is only active when I am running its program.
                I'll update this section if and when I find a solution to this problem!
                In the meantime, enjoy browsing the GitHub page, I suppose.
