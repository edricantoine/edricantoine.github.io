        <p>This is the project that I have been working on the most lately. Inspired by my love of old-school turn-based JRPGs, I have attempted to create a game
            emulating that style, programmed entirely in Java! The GUI was created using the Swing framework, and the turn-based battle system is fully functional. 
            However, I haven't been able to work on this one as much lately, due to being preoccupied with university. <br>

            Currently, the game has two levels, with more planned to be added when I have the time. Also includes something vaguely resembling a storyline. <br>
            I know it's not perfect, but maybe you should give it a try!
            <br>
            Download the game and its .jar file at https://github.com/edricantoine/Hopeful_RPG. The README file contains all you need to know about running the game.
