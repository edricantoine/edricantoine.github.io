            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hi, my name is Edric Antoine, if you couldn't tell already. I am currently a second year student at the University of British Columbia, where I am planning to major in Computer Science.
            This is my personal website, where you can... learn about me, I guess.<br>
            
            My hobbies include programming (of course), as well as drawing (pencil and paper, how it should be), 
            playing the piano, listening to music (mostly rock and some mid-2000s hip-hop), and gaming (fighting games and hack-n-slash type games are my favorite genres).<br>
            
            I've been working on honing my programming skills via working on personal projects, attending events such as hackathons, and even creating this website - my first
            real experience with using HTML and CSS!<br>
            
            Thanks for taking the time to look at my site, and I hope you enjoy!<br>
            -Edric
