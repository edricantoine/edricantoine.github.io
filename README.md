A website published by myself where others will be able to  see the projects I've made, as well as information about myself, my hobbies and interests, and other cool things that I wish to share with others!

Also doubles as an excercise in learning HTML and web development basics.

**THIS WEBSITE IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS! IT IS NOT COMPLETE YET.**

Todo: -Add some sort of JavaScript small web app
        -Polish design of website?

This README will be updated as progress is made on the website.

Enjoy!
